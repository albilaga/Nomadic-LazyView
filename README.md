# Nomadic

## About

[Microsoft News](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.amp.apps.bingnews&hl=en) is built with Xamarin. I wondered‚Ä¶ can I build the same ü§î? So I set out on this journey, I called it Nomadic.

## Getting Started

To be able to run the app you will need to do a little setup. No worries, there's a whole blog about it üôÉ. But if you want a quick start, check the instructions below:

### Create a NewsAPI Key

Head over to [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) and register. Once you have an account, go to your account dashboard and retrieve your API key.

Add your NewsAPI Key in the Constants.cs file at the root of the shared project.

At this point you can build and deploy the Application and you'll have almost all the functionality working üôÉ... login will not work though.

If you're interested in login as well, follow the blog post below to create your Google Client Ids:

## Disclaimer ‚ò†!!

As much as consideration was taken for iOS platform-specific code, this application has not been tested on iOS. In theory it should work, but whatever bugs that you may encounter or on the event that the application does not successfully build or for whatever reason your device bursts into flames, I might not be of help. Sorry üòê.

On a different note, please contribute and/or raise issues üòÅ.
